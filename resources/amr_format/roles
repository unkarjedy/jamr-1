1) Core :ARGx roles. AMR 1.2 uses numbered :ARGx from OntoNotes:
:ARG0, :ARG1, :ARG2, :ARG3, :ARG4, :ARG5

2) Non-core roles:
:accompanier, :age
:beneficiary
:concession, :condition, :consist-of
:degree, :destination, :direction, :domain, :duration
:example, :extent
:frequency
:instrument
:location, :li
:manner, :medium, :mod, :mode
:name
:ord
:part, :path, :polarity, :polite, :poss, :purpose
:quant
:range
:scale, :source, :subevent
:time, :topic
:unit
:value
:wiki

3) Roles used in date-entity:
:calendar, :century, :day, :dayperiod, :decade, :era, :month, :quarter, :season, :timezone, :weekday, :year, :year2

4) Roles of the form :opx are used in conjunctions, and in certain types of locations and times:
:op1, :op2, :op3, :op4, â€¦

5) Roles of the form :prep-X are used in cases where there is no good relation from the list above.
AMR likes to avoid these. Here is a partial list.
It is only partial, as other :prep-X relations are legal AMR.
:prep-against, :prep-along-with, :prep-amid, :prep-among, :prep-as, :prep-at
:prep-by
:prep-for, :prep-from
:prep-in, :prep-in-addition-to, :prep-into
:prep-on, :prep-on-behalf-of, :prep-out-of
:prep-to, :prep-toward
:prep-under
:prep-with, :prep-without
etc...

6) Some conjunctions are also not well-covered under the list of non-core roles.
AMR also likes to avoid these, but sometimes we have no good alternative:
:conj-as-if
etc.

7) All relations above have inverses of the form :X-of.
:ARG0-of, :ARG1-of
:location-of
etc.
